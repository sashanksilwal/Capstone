## Introduction

This project is part of a senior year Capstone project at the New York University. The project is in collaboration with the ComNets. The goal of the project is to implement a machine learning model into the Kiwi browser to accelerate mobile web pages.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three parts:

1. Converting a machine learning model (sklearn classification and clustering) into C++ adaptable format (our choice is ONNX)
2. Implementing a machine learning model into the Kiwi browser
3. Testing the performance of the Kiwi browser with and without the machine learning model
4. Testing the performance of the Kiwi browser with and other existing tools that accelerate mobile web pages

## Project Setup
